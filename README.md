# Seek And Ye Shall Find

Or *saysf*

It started with *CKAN* software sharing data sets.

So C-KAN goes to *seek an*

From there *seek and ye shall find* or *saysfk* for short.


Now *say s f* could be Comma Separated File.

Or a python dictionary.


# What?

For now just a place to record how to work with CKAN.

Interested in hubs of CKAN sites sharing larger data sets.
